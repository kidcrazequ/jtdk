JTDK is JSDK(JavaScript Development Kit)'s alias, is a JavaScript framework, like JDK, help you to develop applications or games faster and easier. 

JSDK project¡®s earliest name is J2J, was founded in 2007. In 2010, I renamed it JSDK, and open source on sourceforge: http://jsdk2.sourceforge.net/website/index.html. The current release version is 0.6.x.

Now, I'm rebuilding the next version 1.0. Github will be as the main source repository.
